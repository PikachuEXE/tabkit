You can download Tab Kit from its [Mozilla Addons page](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/5447).

This doesn't always show the most recent version - for that, you must click the [See All Versions](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addons/versions/5447) link. Versions listed there may have been slightly less tested, but should be fine to use (and may include useful bug fixes).
