Tab Kit is a Firefox addon to make tabs radically more efficient through tab grouping, a vertical tab tree or multiple rows of tabs, and many other useful tweaks. See [About](About.md) for more details.

I write Tab Kit for free in my own time, so while I read all feedback please excuse me for not being able to reply personally to every message - my time is better spent improving Tab Kit.
