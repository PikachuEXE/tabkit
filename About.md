Tab Kit makes tabs more efficient for power users, allowing a wide variety of tweaks, all of which are optional, notably:

  * **Group tabs**, by domain or opener (parent) tab, manually or automatically
  * **Vertical tab tree** (with splitter), like Tree Style Tab
  * **Multi-row** tabs
  * **Sort tabs**, by address, last loaded, last viewed, order of creation, origin or title
  * Control **new tab position** and **close order**
  * Easily **duplicate tabs** and groups and copy/move them between windows by dragging
  * **Scrollwheel tab switch**
  * '**Mouse rocker**' to go back/forward in history
  * **Highlight unread tabs** (and emphasise current tab)
  * **Open Selected Links** feature
  * **Switch tabs on hover**
  * Options for urls, searches and/or bookmarks to open in **new tabs by default**
  * Scrollbar instead of scroll arrows in over-long Bookmarks and All Tabs popups
